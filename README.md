# Overview

Employee Management System is a full-stack web application developed using React (Vite) for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. The application enables users to perform CRUD operations such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting employee records. The frontend communicates with RESTful APIs and displays the data in a responsive and user-friendly UI using Bootstrap.

# Features

Add New Employee: Users can add employee details (First Name, Last Name, Email) and Validations can be added to ensure proper input.

View All Employees: Display all employees in a tabular format and Data is fetched dynamically from the backend API.

Update Employee: Edit employee details directly using the Update button and Auto-fill existing data in the update form.

Delete Employee: Easily remove an employee record using the Delete button and Confirmation logic can be added for safety.

Responsive UI: Built using Bootstrap to ensure mobile-friendly and clean UI.

RESTful API Integration: Frontend communicates with backend via Spring Boot APIs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

React with Vite: Fast development and build time using Vite setup and Component-based structure for better reusability and readability.

Clean Code Structure: Separation of concerns between frontend and backend and Organized folders and reusable components.

Backend with Spring Boot: REST controller with proper HTTP mappings and Uses service and repository layers (standard Java Spring Boot practice).

Cross-Origin Communication: Enabled using @CrossOrigin in Spring Boot to allow frontend-backend integration during development.

# Technologies Used:

Frontend: React JS (Vite), JavaScript, Bootstrap, Axios, React Router DOM
