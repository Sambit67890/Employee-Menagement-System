# Overview

Employee Management System is a full-stack web application developed using React (Vite) for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. The application enables users to perform CRUD operations such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting employee records. The frontend communicates with RESTful APIs and displays the data in a responsive and user-friendly UI using Bootstrap.
